Doing research is what I really love. Coding is a fascinating way to make research easier and better. I like to code and also like to share my code, which you can find on my [GitHub](https://github.com/PsyChiLin). In particular, I am intertest in using [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) code to analyze data, perform statistic, and generate beautiful plots. If youâ€™re an experimental psychologist, cognitive neuroscientist or behavioral scientist, the following software may be particularly useful to you:

- [ggerp](https://github.com/PsyChiLin/ggerp)
- [EFAshiny](https://github.com/PsyChiLin/EFAshiny)
