I am a Psychologist and Cognitive Neuroscientist in Taiwan. I study how people think about the minds of other people, and how this mechanism becomes dysfunction. In particular, social cogntion, empathy and theory of mind (ToM) are the topics under investigation. I have theses goals a combination of three research perspectives – behavioral experiments, neuroimaging and methodology.

I received my B.S in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University University. I am currently a graduate student of master degree in psychology department of from National Taiwan University.

*Loving doing researches appears to light up much of my brain — and do not need an fMRI to tell me.*
