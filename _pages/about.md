Hi ! I am Chi-Lin Yu, a Psychologist, Cognitive Neuroscientist and Methodologist in Taiwan. I study how people think about the minds of other people, how people's internal world interact with external social world, and how these mechanisms become dysfunction. In particular, empathy, social cognition, and social interaction are topics under investigation. I use a combination of three research perspectives – behavioral experiments, neuroimaging and methodology - to understand people's mind. 

I received my B.S in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and my M.S in Psychology from National Taiwan University (NTU). I am currently a research assistant in Psychology of NTU and center for general education of National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).
