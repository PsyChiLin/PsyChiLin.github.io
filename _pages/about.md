Hi! I am Chi-Lin Yu, a Psychologist, Cognitive Neuroscientist and Methodologist from Taiwan. I study how people think about the minds of other people, how people's internal world interact with the external social world, and how these mechanisms develop and become dysfunction.  I use a combination of three research perspectives – behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, and methodology - to understand these questions.

I received my B.S. in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and my M.S. in Psychology from National Taiwan University (NTU). I am doing my Ph.D. training in the Developmental Psychology program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (UM).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Doing research appears to light up much of my brain — which does not require an fMRI to let me know.*
