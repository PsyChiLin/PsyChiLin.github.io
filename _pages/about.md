I am Chi-Lin Yu, a Developmental Psychologist, Cognitive Neuroscientist, and Methodologist from Taiwan. I focus on social cognition in children and adults via behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques, and computational modeling. Specific topics include the underlying mechanism of Theory of Mind (ToM), the development of ToM, how ToM becomes dysfunction in autism and deaf populations, and designing advanced data analysis methods to answer all the aforementioned theoretical questions.

I received my B.S. in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and my M.S. in Psychology from National Taiwan University (NTU). I am currently doing my Ph.D. training in the Developmental Psychology program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (UM). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Doing research lights up much of my brain â€” which doesn't require an fMRI to know that.*
