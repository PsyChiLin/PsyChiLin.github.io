I am Chi-Lin Yu, a Developmental Psychologist, Cognitive Neuroscientist, and Methodologist from Taiwan. My research interest focuses on young children’s acquisition, learning, and development of social-cognitive understanding, studied via behavioral experiments, neuroimaging, psycho- metrics and statistics, and computational modeling. Specific topics include the underlying mechanism/computation of theory of mind, the development of theory of mind, and how the- ory of mind varies across different social-cultural contexts and diverse samples (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, social classes, cultures, and neurodiversity).

I received my B.S. in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and my M.S. in Psychology from National Taiwan University (NTU). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Developmental Psychology program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (U of M).
