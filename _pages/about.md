I am Chi-Lin Yu, a Developmental Psychologist, Cognitive Neuroscientist, and Methodologist from Taiwan. I focus on social cognition in children and adults via behavioral experiments, neuroimaging techniques, psychometric and statistics, and computational modeling. Specific topics include the underlying mechanism of Theory of Mind (ToM), the development of ToM, and how ToM becomes dysfunctional in clinical populations.

I received my B.S. in Psychology from National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) and my M.S. in Psychology from National Taiwan University (NTU). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Developmental Psychology program at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (U of M). 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Doing research lights up much of my brain â€” which doesn't require an fMRI to know that.*
