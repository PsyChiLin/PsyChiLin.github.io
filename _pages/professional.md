Experience
======
- **Researcher and Data Scientist**, Language Neuroscience Laboratory, , Department of Psychology, National Taiwan University. *Mentor: Prof. Tai-Li Chou, PhD*
    - Develop functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies to investigate the underlying
mechanism of social cognition in typical developing children.
    - Identify aberrant cognitive organizations in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients and propose a framework for their atypical social processing.
    - Understand the differences in neural correlates of semantic processing between typical developing subjects and schizophrenia patients.
    - Investigate language comprehension and the corresponding neural activities in bilingual adults.
    - Design a new analysis method that implement machine learning algorithms to analyze near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data.
    - Establish a model to interpret the mechanism of human empathy.

- **Researcher and Data Scientist**, Language Acquisition and Cognitive
Development Laboratory, Department of Psychology, National Cheng Kung University. *Mentor: Prof. Jon-Fan Hu, PhD*
    - Pioneer Taiwan’s NIRS research to explore the neural mechanism of first impression formation.
    - Adopt behavioral experiments in embodied perspective to probe semantic properties of emotion words.
    - Develop fMRI study to investigate the underlying relationships between ToM and humor processing.
    - Establish the valid and reliable scale to measure self-report empathy ability
    - Design developmental experiments to understand the interaction between ToM, empathy and social development.

- **Researcher and Programmer**, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory, National Cheng Kung University, Department of Psychology. *Mentor: Prof. Der-Yow Chen, PhD*
    - Develop a multi-fMRI scanners hyper-scanning paradigm to investigate the neural underpinnings of social interaction.
    - Investigate the relationship between perspective taking and emotion processing using interactive social decision-making tasks.
    - Probe the underlying metalizing processes and cognitive abilities of playing Chinese Go from the experimental psychology perspective.
