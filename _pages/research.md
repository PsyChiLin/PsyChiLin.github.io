### Empathy
Human beings are physically independent but are psychologically intertwined. We spend a lot of time dealing with others’ intentions, experiences, and internal states. The term empathy describes these phenomena. I explore the underlying porcessing of empathy from normal population and autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral experiments. An atypical brain organization of empathy for individuals with autism is revealed. I also propose a dual route model of empathy to interpret the underlying mechanisms of empathy processing. The dual route model is mainly composed of an automatic, fast, and specific “lower route” with affective empathy as well as a complex, slow, and iterative “higher route” with cognitive empathy.
