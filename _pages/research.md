### Empathy
Human beings are physically independent but are psychologically intertwined (Zaki and Ochsner, 2016). We spend a lot of time dealing with others’ intentions, experiences, and internal states. The term empathy describes these phenomena. 
Previous studies defined empathy as “the ability and tendency to share and understand others’ internal state” (Zaki and Ochsner, 2012). Consistent with this definition, accumulated empirical evidence showed that empathy is a multifaceted construct composed of three key components, including affective empathy, cognitive empathy, and prosocial motivation (Hoffman, 1984; Decety and Jackson, 2004; Singer, 2006; Uddin et al., 2007; Shamay-Tsoory et al., 2009; Zaki and Ochsner, 2016). Despite ever-growing findings related to the neural underpinnings of empathy in these aforementioned studies, little is known to have a general framework to explain the relationship between key components. 
Therefore, I explore the underlying porcessing of empathy and propose a dual route model of empathy to interpret the underlying mechanisms of empathy processing. The dual route model is mainly composed of an automatic, fast, and specific “lower route” with affective empathy as well as a complex, slow, and iterative “higher route” with cognitive empathy. Details of these studies will beshown soon.
