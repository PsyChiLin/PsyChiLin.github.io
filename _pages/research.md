### Empathy

Human beings are physically independent but are psychologically intertwined. We spend a lot of time dealing with others’ intentions, experiences, and internal states. The term empathy describes these phenomena. 
I explore the underlying porcessing of empathy from normal population and autism using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioral experiments. I aslo develop new task and translate new scale to examine the development of empathy from typical developing child.
The brain organzation for empathy porcessing is revealed; and, an aberrant brain pattern of empathy for individuals with autism is revealed. I also propose a dual route model of empathy to interpret the underlying mechanisms of empathy processing. The dual route model of empathy is mainly composed of an automatic, fast, and specific “lower route” with affective empathy as well as a complex, slow, and iterative “higher route” with cognitive empathy.
